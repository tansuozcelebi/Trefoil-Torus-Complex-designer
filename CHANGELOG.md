### Added
- Parametric trefoil knot implemented as `TrefoilCurve` and rendered with `THREE.TubeGeometry`.
- Interactive GUI (dat.GUI) for geometry, material, lighting, view, and transform controls.
- MeshPhysicalMaterial with Fresnel highlight via `onBeforeCompile`.
- Wireframe overlay, screenshot export, GLTF export placeholder.
- OrbitControls (mouse orbit/zoom/pan), shadows, Reflector-based reflection toggle, and LOD heuristics.
- Basic unit test for `TrefoilCurve`.

### Fixed
